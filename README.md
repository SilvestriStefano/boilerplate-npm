# Backend Challenges boilerplate - package.json
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/silvestristefano/boilerplate-npm)](https://repl.it/github/silvestristefano/boilerplate-npm)

This repo was used to complete the exercises in the first lesson ["Managing Packages with NPM"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#managing-packages-with-npm) of the course ["Back-End Development and APIs"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/).

I started by cloning the boirlerplate, then made a branch for each exercise.
